Bounce was a homepage I made to make my school laptop just a bit more unique from everyone else's. It features three bouncing circles. Pressing <kbd>space</kbd> adds circles to the screen, while pressing <kbd>c</kbd> takes them away.

I wanted to have fun and make something unique, and in the end, I was really proud of the result! It was cool to take an open-ended idea like "make a more interesting web browser home page" and brainstorm different implementations.
