title: Building a text processing pipeline with Unified
description: Spellcheck, grammar check, Markdown, HTML, and more!
tags: [javascript]

[Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) is a set of software packages designed to work with text data. Many projects including [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) uses it to render markdown. In this post, I'll walk through setting up a processor using Unified. We'll start by just processing `.txt` files, but by the end, we'll have a working compiler from Markdown to HTML. We'll also write several of our own plugins for Unified.

I'm going to assume some basic familiarity with JavaScript and NPM, but my hope is that those new to Node or modern JavaScript will still be able to follow along. That said, the topics will gradually get more difficult as the post continues.

# Setup

Unified is written as JavaScript modules intended to be run with NodeJS. Start by setting up a new `npm` package.

```bash
mkdir unified-example
cd unified-example
npm init -y
```

This will generate a `package.json` file for you.

The Unified ecosystem uses ECMAScript modules exclusively. However, Node defaults to using CommonJS modules. We will need to modify the `package.json` file to enable modules. Open up this folder in your text editor of choice, and add a `"type": "module"` declaration at the end:

```json
{
  [...],
  "type": "module"
}
```

Next, we can install Unified itself.

```bash
npm install unified
```

Let's create an `index.js` file for our code.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";

const processor = unified();
```

And finally, add an `npm run build` command to our `package.json`. Modify the `"scripts"` section to add the following.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node ./index.js",
    ...
  }
```

We can now run our pipeline with `npm run build`.

And... nothing happened! That's okay: We aren't feeding anything to our processor yet.

# Input and Output

Let's configure our processor to read from a `src` directory, and write to a `dist` directory.

```bash
mkdir src
mkdir dist
```

Now, we need some way to run multiple files through our pipeline. We can use `unified-engine` for this. The engine will select all files from our source paths, run them through the processor, and output them to the destination path.

```bash
npm install unified-engine
```

And finally, let's use it in our code.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";

const processor = unified();

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  try {
    engine(
      {
        processor,
        files: ["./src/**/*.txt"],
        output: "./dist",
      },
      resolve
    );
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
});
```

> `unified-engine` will call a callback function when it is finished processing all files. Unfortunately, it doesn't support `await`-ing the result directly. So, we use `await new Promise` to wait for the callback. If you aren't familiar with Promises, you can think of this as "waiting for the callback to be called" instead of writing a separate callback function.

Now, if we run this... still nothing. We don't have any files to process. We can make an `index.txt` file in the `src` directory, and run it again:

```bash
echo "Hello world" > src/index.txt
npm run build
```

```
./src/index.txt

    at file:///Users/breq/code/unified-example/node_modules/unified-engine/lib/configuration.js:138:11

✖ 1 error
```

The pipeline is trying to process our input file, but it doesn't have any parser configured.

# Parsers

Parsers are what Unified uses to convert an input file into a syntax tree. They exist for plaintext (`.txt` files), Markdown, and HTML.

In general, packages to work with Unified are split into three groups: `remark` for handling markdown, `rehype` for handling HTML, and `retext` for handling plain text.

For our example, we're reading in a `.txt` file. We can use a `retext` plugin to convert it to a syntax tree. Currently, `retext` plugins are available for English and Dutch, plus a catchall `retext-latin` plugin for languages that use Latin-based scripts.

Let's assume we're going to work exclusively with English.

```bash
npm install retext-english
```

And now, we can add our parser to our pipeline.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";
import retextEnglish from "retext-english";

const processor = unified().use(retextEnglish);

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // ...
});
```

Give it another `npm run build` and...

```
./src/index.txt

    at done (file:///Users/breq/code/unified-example/node_modules/trough/index.js:145:7)

✖ 1 error
```

Our pipeline is processing our file, but it can't stringify and save the result. This is where we need a compiler.

# Compilers

Compilers are what Unified uses to convert a syntax tree back into a file. Just like with parsers, they exist for all sorts of markup languages. For now, let's keep things simple and output the result as a `.txt` file.

Again, the `retext` ecosystem will help us. We can use `retext-stringify` as our compiler to output another `.txt` file.

```bash
npm install retext-stringify
```

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";
import retextEnglish from "retext-english";
import retextStringify from "retext-stringify";

const processor = unified().use(retextEnglish).use(retextStringify);

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  ...
});
```

Finally, our pipeline runs! We now have a `dist/index.txt` file containing our "Hello world" text.

...so what was the point of this? Right now, it seems like all we have is a complicated way to copy files between directories. But the intermediate syntax tree is where the magic happens—we can perform all sorts of processing steps on our text.

# Syntax Trees

Before diving into what syntax trees let us do, let's take a look at what one looks like.

Syntax trees in Unified follow the [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) specification. This spec defines _nodes_, which can be either _parent_ nodes (which contain other nodes) or _literal_ nodes (which contain some specific value).

The `unist-util-inspect` package is a useful tool for inspecting `unist` syntax trees. Let's add it to our pipeline.

```bash
npm install unist-util-inspect
```

Using this library is a bit tricky right now. `unist-util-inspect` isn't aware of any of the Unified tooling we have—it's just a function that takes in a syntax tree. We need to hook into the pipeline somehow.

To do this, we need to write our own plugin.

## Making a Plugin

In the Unified ecosystem, a plugin is a function that takes in some options and returns another function. The returned function is then called on the syntax tree.

Let's write a plugin called `inspectPlugin` that logs the syntax tree to the console.

```js
// ...
import { inspect } from "unist-util-inspect";

function inspectPlugin(options = {}) {
  return (tree, file) => {
    console.log(inspect(tree));
  };
}

const processor = unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .use(inspectPlugin);

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // ...
});
```

Not too bad, right? Writing our own plugin only took 5 lines of code. Now, if we run our pipeline again, we should see:

```
RootNode[2] (1:1-2:1, 0-12)
├─0 ParagraphNode[1] (1:1-1:12, 0-11)
│   └─0 SentenceNode[3] (1:1-1:12, 0-11)
│       ├─0 WordNode[1] (1:1-1:6, 0-5)
│       │   └─0 TextNode "Hello" (1:1-1:6, 0-5)
│       ├─1 WhiteSpaceNode " " (1:6-1:7, 5-6)
│       └─2 WordNode[1] (1:7-1:12, 6-11)
│           └─0 TextNode "world" (1:7-1:12, 6-11)
└─1 WhiteSpaceNode "\n" (1:12-2:1, 11-12)
```

This is the syntax tree that our pipeline built. Specifically, this is the tree that `retext-english` created, and it's what `retext-stringify` used to compile our output file.

# Text Processing

## Spell Checking

There are plenty of `retext` plugins that can work with text. Let's start by adding spell checking to our pipeline using `retext-spell`. We also need to install a dictionary package: let's use `dictionary-en`.

```bash
npm install retext-spell dictionary-en
```

Now add

```js
import retextSpell from "retext-spell";
import dictionary from "dictionary-en";
```

to the imports, and add

```js
const processor = unified()
  // ...
  .use(retextSpell, { dictionary });
```

to the processor. You might notice that we're passing in an object to `.use`. These are the configuration options for the plugin. Most plugins take in optional options of some sort, but in this case, `retext-spell` requires the `dictionary` option.

Run our pipeline again, and nothing extra should happen. Let's misspell some words and run it again!

```bash
echo "Ehllo world" > src/index.txt
npm run build
```

```
  1:1-1:6  warning  `Ehllo` is misspelt; did you mean `Hello`?  ehllo  retext-spell

⚠ 1 warning
```

And there you have it: spell checking!

## Other ReText Plugins

We can pull in more plugins, too. But first, let's get a bit more source text. I'm going to use a snippet of one of my project writeups:

```
The STM32 microcontroller this project used doesn't have any purpose-built
hardware for generating sounds (that I'm aware of). So, the solution I
settled on was to manually generate a square wave by setting a GPIO pin
high, waiting for half the length of the waveform, setting it low, and
waiting for the rest of the waveform.

The biggest hurdle with this approach was accurate timing. The STM32 can
use interrupts to delay for a precise number of milliseconds, but
generating square waves at specific frequencies requires sub-millisecond
precision. The solution I came up with was to calibrate a busy-wait loop
when the code begins using the millisecond timer, then use that busy-wait
loop for sub-millisecond-precision delays. This yielded a decent-sounding
square wave, but the game audio still felt incomplete.
```

We should also probably stop logging the entire syntax tree to the console. Comment out the `console.log` for now in our custom plugin.

Let's install some more prose plugins. I'm going to throw pretty much the entire suite of plugins into our pipeline.

```bash
npm install retext-contractions retext-diacritics retext-equality retext-indefinite-article retext-profanities retext-repeated-words retext-smartypants retext-quotes
```

Our full code should now look like:

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";
import retextEnglish from "retext-english";
import retextStringify from "retext-stringify";
import { inspect } from "unist-util-inspect";
import retextSpell from "retext-spell";
import dictionary from "dictionary-en";
import retextContractions from "retext-contractions";
import retextDiacritics from "retext-diacritics";
import retextEquality from "retext-equality";
import retextIndefiniteArticle from "retext-indefinite-article";
import retextProfanities from "retext-profanities";
import retextRepeatedWords from "retext-repeated-words";
import retextSmartypants from "retext-smartypants";
import retextQuotes from "retext-quotes";

function inspectPlugin(options = {}) {
  return (tree, file) => {
    // console.log(inspect(tree));
  };
}

const processor = unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .use(inspectPlugin)
  .use(retextSpell, { dictionary })
  .use(retextContractions)
  .use(retextDiacritics)
  .use(retextEquality)
  .use(retextIndefiniteArticle)
  .use(retextProfanities)
  .use(retextRepeatedWords)
  .use(retextSmartypants)
  .use(retextQuotes);

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  try {
    engine(
      {
        processor,
        files: ["./src/**/*.txt"],
        output: "./dist",
      },
      resolve
    );
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
});
```

And run! The file was written to `./dist/index.txt` successfully, but there were a few warnings:

```
./src/index.txt > dist/index.txt
     1:5-1:10  warning  `STM32` is misspelt; did you mean `STM32nd`?                     stm32             retext-spell
    1:11-1:26  warning  `microcontroller` is misspelt                                    microcontroller   retext-spell
    1:45-1:52  warning  Expected the apostrophe in `doesn't` to be like this: `doesn’t`  smart-apostrophe  retext-contractions
  1:113-1:116  warning  Expected the apostrophe in `I'm` to be like this: `I’m`          smart-apostrophe  retext-contractions
  1:210-1:214  warning  `GPIO` is misspelt; did you mean `GPO`?                          gpio              retext-spell
    3:64-3:69  warning  `STM32` is misspelt; did you mean `STM32nd`?                     stm32             retext-spell

⚠ 6 warnings
```

A few technical words ("STM32", "microcontroller", "GPIO") are incorrectly detected as misspelled. We can add a personal dictionary to resolve this.

```bash
echo "STM32\nmicrocontroller\nGPIO" > dictionary.txt
```

Now, we can configure `retext-spell` to use our personal dictionary.

```js
import fs from "fs/promises";
const personal = await fs.readFile("./dictionary.txt", "utf8");

// ...
const processor = unified()
  // ...
  .use(retextSpell, {
    dictionary,
    personal,
  });
```

Now, we only have quote errors remaining. `retext-contractions` expects us to use smart apostrophes. `retext-smartypants` adds those automatically. If you look at `dist/index.txt`, you'll see that `doesn't` is now `doesn’t`. So why is `retext-contractions` complaining?

## Plugin Types and Plugin Order

The issue is the order that our plugins are being used. Since `retext-contractions` comes before `retext-smartypants`, the smart quote insertion happens after the smart quotes are checked.

However, you might notice that `retext-stringify` is the second plugin we use, yet the other plugins modify the tree before it is stringified and written to disk. Why?

The answer is that `retext-stringify` works a bit differently than you'd expect. Instead of performing some operation on the tree directly, it configures the processor object, setting itself as the compiler. This means that even though the plugin is one of the first in the pipeline, nothing is executed until the pipeline reaches the compile step.

Let's reorder our plugins. I'm going to list the parser first, then the plugins that modify the tree (`retext-smartypants`), then those that check the tree (including `retext-contractions`), and finally the compiler (`retext-stringify`). Again, the parser and compiler can go anywhere in the order, but placing them at the beginning and end reduces confusion.

Our pipeline should run without warnings!

Now's a good time to stop and test out some of the plugins we're using:

- Spell something wrong for `retext-spell` to catch
- Put an apostrophe in the wrong place (e.g. `do'nt`)
- Miss some diacritics (e.g. `a la carte`)
- Use `a example` instead of `an example`
- Repeat a word, `The bird in the the bush`
- Use gendered language (e.g. `postman`)
- Use profane language (e.g. `stupid`)

Unfortunately, with any large amount of text, a lot of false positives can occur. In most cases, you'll only want to use a few of these plugins to lint your text. I'm going to remove `retext-contractions` and `retext-diacritics` at this step.

# Markdown

You'll probably want to use Markdown for any serious work. Markdown allows you to embed links, images, code blocks, and other content into your text.

This is where the `remark` family of plugins can help. We'll use `remark-parse` to parse our Markdown files, and `remark-stringify` to convert the tree back to Markdown.

```bash
npm install remark-parse remark-stringify
```

## Splitting the pipeline

Right now, our plugins are designed to work with and modify a text syntax tree. If we want to process Markdown, we'll need some way to convert the Markdown syntax tree into a text syntax tree.

This is more complicated than it sounds. We can't use a plugin to replace the Markdown syntax tree with a text one, since we still need to output the Markdown.

What we _can_ do is create a separate pipeline that only deals with prose. Let's move our existing pipeline to a new file, `prose.js`.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import retextEnglish from "retext-english";
import retextStringify from "retext-stringify";
import retextSpell from "retext-spell";
import dictionary from "dictionary-en";
import retextEquality from "retext-equality";
import retextIndefiniteArticle from "retext-indefinite-article";
import retextProfanities from "retext-profanities";
import retextRepeatedWords from "retext-repeated-words";
import retextSmartypants from "retext-smartypants";
import retextQuotes from "retext-quotes";
import fs from "fs/promises";
const personal = await fs.readFile("./dictionary.txt", "utf8");

const processor = unified()
  // Parser
  .use(retextEnglish)

  // Transform prose
  .use(retextSmartypants)

  // Check prose
  .use(retextSpell, {
    dictionary,
    personal,
  })
  .use(retextEquality)
  .use(retextIndefiniteArticle)
  .use(retextProfanities)
  .use(retextRepeatedWords)
  .use(retextQuotes)

  // Compiler
  .use(retextStringify);

export default processor;
```

Now, we can import this in our `index.js`.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";
import processor from "./prose.js";

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  try {
    engine(
      {
        processor,
        files: ["./src/**/*.txt"],
        output: "./dist",
      },
      resolve
    );
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
});
```

## Parsing Markdown

We need some Markdown to parse. I'm using [this](/unified-example/markdown.md) as my source. Save it as `src/index.md`.

Next, we'll make a new pipeline that can parse Markdown, using `remark-parse` and `remark-stringify`. We'll also configure our engine to look for `.md` files instead of `.txt` files.

```js
import { unified } from "unified";
import { engine } from "unified-engine";
import remarkParse from "remark-parse";
import remarkStringify from "remark-stringify";

const processor = unified().use(remarkParse).use(remarkStringify);

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  try {
    engine(
      {
        processor,
        files: ["./src/**/*.md"],
        output: "./dist",
      },
      resolve
    );
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
});
```

Next, we need to actually do the split. If we want to bridge from Markdown to text, from `remark` to `retext`, we can use `remark-retext`!

```bash
npm install remark-retext
```

```js
// ...
import remarkRetext from "remark-retext";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRetext)
  .use(remarkStringify);
// ...
```

You'll notice that this gives an error, though. The `remark-retext` plugin is looking for some `retext` parser to use. This is where our original prose pipeline comes in.

```js
// ...
import prosePipeline from "./prose.js";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkStringify);
// ...
```

And now, the pipeline should run! You'll probably see some warnings about spelling, showing that the markdown content is getting fed through the spell checker. You might want to update the dictionary before moving on.

## Mutating Markdown

Look at `dist/index.md`. What happened to the smart quotes? In the prose pipeline, we feed our text through `retext-smartypants` to convert straight quotes and apostrophes to curly/smart quotes. But that isn't being reflected in the Markdown output.

_Once we split the pipeline, any changes we make to the text syntax tree won't propagate back to the Markdown tree._ Splitting is a one-way process.

Thankfully, we can use `remark-smartypants` instead of `retext-smartypants` to mutate the Markdown tree.

```bash
npm install remark-smartypants
```

Add it to the Markdown pipeline:

```js
// ...
import remarkSmartypants from "remark-smartypants";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkSmartypants)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkStringify);

// ...
```

Finally, remove `retext-smartypants` from the prose pipeline. Run the pipeline again, and you should see smart quotes in the Markdown output. You should also see that `retext-quotes` doesn't complain about quote usage. Since we apply `retext-smartypants` before splitting the pipeline, the changes are also reflected in the prose syntax tree.

## More Markdown Plugins

Let's add a few more plugins to our pipeline.

- `remark-slug`: Generate a slug for each heading, letting people link directly to it.
- `remark-gfm`: Parse GitHub-style tables.
- `remark-frontmatter`: Parse YAML frontmatter.

```bash
npm install remark-slug remark-gfm remark-frontmatter
```

```js
// ...
import remarkSmartypants from "remark-smartypants";
import remarkSlug from "remark-slug";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import remarkFrontmatter from "remark-frontmatter";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkFrontmatter)
  .use(remarkGfm)
  .use(remarkSlug)
  .use(remarkSmartypants)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkStringify);
// ...
```

Try adding some frontmatter, tables, etc. to the Markdown file.

```md
---
title: "Hello World"
---

| this | is    |
| ---- | ----- |
| a    | table |
```

Right now, we're just taking in Markdown and spitting it out. Let's try actually rendering it to HTML.

# HTML

Just as `remark` is used for Markdown, `rehype` is used for HTML. Instead of writing our Markdown pipeline back to Markdown, let's transform it to HTML and write that out.

We'll need `remark-rehype` to transform Markdown to HTML, and `rehype-stringify` to write the HTML back to a file. We'll also use `vfile-rename` to rename the `.md` files to `.html` files.

```bash
npm install remark-rehype rehype-stringify vfile-rename
```

Now, we can add these to our pipeline. `vfile-rename` isn't a proper plugin, but it only takes a bit of code to make it work.

```js
// ...
import remarkRehype from "remark-rehype";
import rehypeStringify from "rehype-stringify";
import { rename } from "vfile-rename";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkFrontmatter)
  .use(remarkGfm)
  .use(remarkSlug)
  .use(remarkSmartypants)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(() => (tree, file) => {
    rename(file, { extname: ".html" });
  })
  .use(rehypeStringify);

// ...
```

Run the pipeline again, and you should see `index.html` with the output.

## Document Structure

You might notice that the `index.html` doesn't include `<head>` and `<body>`. In order to actually create a complete HTML document, we need to add those. `rehype-document` can turn an HTML fragment into a full document.

```bash
npm install rehype-document
```

Add it to the pipeline, and you should see a complete HTML document.

## Title

Our `index.html` has a `<title>` tag, but it's just set to `index`. Ideally, we'd want to be able to set the title from the frontmatter.

There's no existing plugin to take care of this, but we can write one ourselves. We can extract the title from the frontmatter using `remark-extract-frontmatter`, and then use `hast-util-select` and `hast-util-from-string` to modify the `<title>` tag.

```bash
npm install hast-util-select hast-util-from-string remark-extract-frontmatter yaml
```

Adding these, our pipeline looks like this:

```js
// ...
import { select } from "hast-util-select";
import { fromString } from "hast-util-from-string";
import YAML from "yaml";
import remarkFrontmatter from "remark-frontmatter";

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkFrontmatter)
  .use(remarkExtractFrontmatter, { yaml: YAML.parse })
  .use(remarkGfm)
  .use(remarkSlug)
  .use(remarkSmartypants)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeDocument, {
    title: "Untitled",
  })
  .use(() => (tree, file) => {
    const title = file.data.title || "Untitled";
    const tag = select("title", tree);
    if (tag) {
      fromString(tag, title);
    }
  })
  .use(() => (tree, file) => {
    rename(file, { extname: ".html" });
  })
  .use(rehypeStringify);
```

Set the `title` property in the frontmatter of the markdown, and check that it is updated in the `.html` output.

## Formatting

Right now, the HTML output isn't particularly readable. We can add `rehype-format` to clean things up. Alternatively, you might want to `rehype-minify` to reduce the file size.

```bash
npm install rehype-format
```

Add this to the pipeline right before the call to `.use(rehypeStringify)`.

## Code

Add some code to the `index.md`.

````
```js
() => (tree, file) => {
  const title = file.data.title || "Untitled";
  const tag = select("title", tree);
  if (tag) {
    fromString(tag, title);
  }
};
```
````

The HTML output is fine. The code is printed in a monospace font. However, in most cases, you'll want to display code with syntax highlighting. The Prism library is a popular choice, and it's supported in Unified through `rehype-prism`.

```bash
npm install @mapbox/rehype-prism
```

```js
  .use(rehypePrism)
```

This won't work on its own, however. We need to add the Prism theme to actually apply the highlighting. Thankfully, all we need to do is add the URL to the `css` option of `rehype-document`.

```js
.use(rehypeDocument, {
    title: "Untitled",
    css: [
      "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.25.0/themes/prism.min.css",
    ],
})
```

There it is! Language-specific code highlighting has been added to the pipeline.

## Math

There are a lot of cases where you might want to include math in your Markdown. To accomplish this, math is typically written using LaTeX inside of `$` blocks. Here's what it looks like:

```md
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
```

Getting math to display in our pipeline takes two steps. First, when parsing Markdown, we need to add a new plugin to extract the math blocks into syntax tree nodes. Then, we need a plugin to render the LaTeX to HTML once we have our HTML syntax tree.

There are two major math libraries for the web: MathJAX and KaTeX. We'll proceed using KaTeX, since it is more lightweight.

```bash
npm install remark-math rehype-katex
```

Next, add these to the pipeline, and add the KaTeX CSS similarly to how we added the Prism theme. The pipeline looks like this:

```js
const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkFrontmatter)
  .use(remarkExtractFrontmatter, { yaml: YAML.parse })
  .use(remarkGfm)
  .use(remarkMath)
  .use(remarkSlug)
  .use(remarkSmartypants)
  .use(remarkRetext, prosePipeline)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypePrism)
  .use(rehypeKatex)
  .use(rehypeDocument, {
    title: "Untitled",
  })
  .use(rehypeDocument, {
    title: "Untitled",
    css: [
      "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.25.0/themes/prism.min.css",
      "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.15.1/katex.min.css",
    ],
  })
  .use(() => (tree, file) => {
    const title = file.data.title || "Untitled";
    const tag = select("title", tree);
    if (tag) {
      fromString(tag, title);
    }
  })
  .use(() => (tree, file) => {
    rename(file, { extname: ".html" });
  })
  .use(rehypeFormat)
  .use(rehypeStringify);
```

Both `remark-math` and `rehype-katex` support both inline and block mode math. Inline mode can be written using a single `$` as a delimiter, and block mode uses two `$$`.

## Music

You also might want to include sheet music notation in your Markdown. The most popular notation for embedding music notation in websites is [ABC](https://abcnotation.com/). There aren't any working `remark` libraries for this, but we can write our own.

For syntax, let's use three backticks like a code block, and set the language to `abc`.

````
```abc
X: 1
T: Nokia Tune
M: 3/4
L: 1/8
K: Amaj
| e'd' f2 g2 | c'b d2 e2 | ba c2 e2 | a6 |
```
````

Now, we can start writing our plugin. Create a new file, `music.js`:

```js
const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {};
};

export default remarkMusic;
```

Import the plugin and add it to the pipeline in `main.js`.

The next step is to select the music nodes in the syntax tree. Let's start by just `inspect`ing the whole tree, to get a sense of what we're looking for.

```js
import { inspect } from "unist-util-inspect";

const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {
    console.log(inspect(tree));
  };
};

export default remarkMusic;
```

```
...
└─10 code "X: 1\nT: Nokia Tune\nM: 3/4\nL: 1/8\nK: Amaj\n| e'd' f2 g2 | c'b d2 e2 | ba c2 e2 | a6 |" (42:1-49:4, 1623-1717)
      lang: "abc"
      meta: null
```

All right, our music is in the syntax tree, in a node with `type="code"` and `lang="abc"`. Let's start by mapping the `code` nodes to `abc` nodes.

To perform this mapping, we can use `unist-util-map`.

```bash
npm install unist-util-map
```

```js
// ...
import { map } from "unist-util-map";

const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {
    return map(tree, (node) => {
      if (node.type === "code" && node.lang === "abc") {
        return {
          type: "abc",
          value: node.value,
        };
      } else {
        return node;
      }
    });
  };
};

// ...
```

If you run the pipeline now, you'll see that the ABC source is now just kind of dropped into the HTML. Unsurprisingly, `remark-rehype` has no idea what to do with it.

If, however, we add a `data` field to the `abc` nodes we create, we will be able to pass an HTML syntax tree node to `remark-rehype`.

```js
const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {
    return map(tree, (node) => {
      if (node.type === "code" && node.lang === "abc") {
        return {
          type: "abc",
          value: node.value,
          data: {
            hName: "div",
            hProperties: {
              className: ["abc"],
              style: "color: red",
            },
            hChildren: [
              {
                type: "text",
                value: node.value,
              },
            ],
          },
        };
      } else {
        return node;
      }
    });
  };
};
```

In this example, we just create a `div` for the ABC source, and show it in red.

However, if we want to actually render ABC to HTML, we'll need to use a library that works with the DOM. Let's get things set up beforehand by creating a DOM element and converting it to an AST node.

Since we're working with Node, we don't have access to a global `document` object from which to call `createElement`. Instead, we can use `JSDOM`. We'll also need `hast-util-from-dom` to convert the DOM node to an AST node.

```bash
npm install jsdom hast-util-from-dom
```

```js
import { JSDOM } from "jsdom";
import { fromDom } from "hast-util-from-dom";
// ...

const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {
    return map(tree, (node) => {
      if (node.type === "code" && node.lang === "abc") {
        const {
          window: { document },
        } = new JSDOM();

        const renderInto = document.createElement("div");
        renderInto.innerHTML = node.value;
        renderInto.style.color = "red";

        const data = fromDom(renderInto);

        return {
          type: "abc",
          value: node.value,
          data: {
            hName: data.tagName,
            hProperties: data.properties,
            hChildren: data.children,
          },
        };
      } else {
        return node;
      }
    });
  };
};

// ...
```

All right! We've done almost everything we need, all that's left is to map some ABC source to an HTML DOM node. Thankfully, considering the popularity of ABC notation, there's a library for that: `abcjs`.

```bash
npm install abcjs
```

Now, we just tell `abcjs` to render into our `JSDOM` node.

```js
const remarkMusic = () => {
  return (tree, file) => {
    return map(tree, (node) => {
      if (node.type === "code" && node.lang === "abc") {
        const {
          window: { document },
        } = new JSDOM();

        const renderInto = document.createElement("div");
        ABCJS.renderAbc(renderInto, node.value);
        const data = fromDom(renderInto);

        return {
          type: "abc",
          value: node.value,
          data: {
            hName: data.tagName,
            hProperties: data.properties,
            hChildren: data.children,
          },
        };
      } else {
        return node;
      }
    });
  };
};
```

If you're following along, you might get an error after this step. ABCJS relied in the global `window` object, which doesn't exist in Node, up until [this commit](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs/commit/a2f7aa3d1e56129c50bda055ac5b1d70eb99d39d#diff-0396bfd9215f5827170dbea5ff6109b231a55af9bab8c7a2a094aae98da55fc0). At time of writing, it hasn't made it into a proper release yet. As a workaround, you can install the 6.0.0 beta:

```bash
npm install abcjs@^6.0.0-beta
```

And... still doesn't work. When rendering to a DOM node, ABCJS tries to call `document.createElement`, which (obviously) fails. We will need to patch the package manually.

```bash
npm install patch-package
```

I added the following patch:

```diff
diff --git a/node_modules/abcjs/src/write/svg.js b/node_modules/abcjs/src/write/svg.js
index 174602b..fae9221 100644

+const document = (new JSDOM()).window.document;
+
 var svgNS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";

 function Svg(wrapper) {
```

And... there we go! Runs without issue, and transforms our ABC source into beautiful sheet music.

# Pulling it all together

Let's throw a few more styles in, just to make things look a bit nicer.

```js
.use(rehypeDocument, {
  title: "Untitled",
  css: [
    "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.25.0/themes/prism.min.css",
    "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.15.1/katex.min.css",
    "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/4.6.1/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  ],
  style: "body { margin: 0 auto !important; max-width: 800px; }",
})
```

And finally, let's throw some markdown at this! Here's a snippet that includes basically everything we're doing:

````md

title: My Awesome Markdown

# Hello, World!

This is a Markdown document. It's a good test for our pipeline. I hope I ~~spellled~~ everything right. If someone finds a spelling **error**, she should let me [know](mailto:breq@breq.dev).

- This is a list item
- This is another list item

1. This is a numbered list item
1. This is another numbered list item

## Tables

| $x$ | $x^2$ |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | 1     |
| 2   | 4     |
| 3   | 9     |

## Formulas

$$
x! = \begin{cases}
  x = 0: & 1 \\
  x > 0: & x (x - 1)! \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Code

```python
def bisect(f, a, b):
  c = (a + b) / 2
  if f(c) == 0:
    return c
  elif f(a) * f(c) < 0:
    return bisect(f, a, c)
  else:
    return bisect(f, c, b)
```

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <span>Hello, world!</span>;
}
```

## Music

```abc
X: 1
T: Nokia Tune
M: 3/4
L: 1/8
K: Amaj
| e'd' f2 g2 | c'b d2 e2 | ba c2 e2 | a6 |
```
````

And, let's render it one last time.

![](unified-example.png)

Looks nice! And we'll check the warnings:

```
./src/index.md > dist/index.html
   8:3-8:11  warning  `spellled` is misspelt; did you mean `spelled`?     spellled  retext-spell
  8:71-8:74  warning  `she` may be insensitive, use `they`, `it` instead  he-she    retext-equality

⚠ 2 warnings
```

The pipeline is warning us about both the spelling error and the unnecessary use of gendered language.

## Summary

We've built a pipeline that, ultimately, turns Markdown into HTML. But we've used the Unified ecosystem to add plenty of other features:

- Use YAML frontmatter to set the page title
- Use Github-Flavored Markdown to render tables, strikethroughs, and other features absent from CommonMark (the commonly used Markdown spec).
- Parse ABC notation and render sheet music
- Add syntax highlighting to code blocks
- Render LaTeX math formulas
- Add slugs to headings to support direct linking
- Convert simple/straight quotes into smart quotes
- Pretty-print the output HTML

As well as our prose pipeline, which checks the source text for:

- Spelling mistakes, including use of a personal dictionary to ignore certain words
- Potentially insensitive or inconsiderate language (such as gendered pronouns)
- Improper use of "a" versus "an"
- Potentially profane language
- Words that are are improperly repeated
- Mistakes with quote usage

This is quite the feature set! And it goes to show just how broad the Unified ecosystem is. Most of these plugins could be added to the pipeline with just one line of code.

You can see the final result [in this repo](https://github.com/breqdev/unified-example).

## Epilogue

One final note: over the course of writing this, I actually decided to publish the music plugin to NPM. It's available as `remark-abcjs`, and it bundles a patched version of `abcjs` to avoid having to patch it yourself. Give it a try!

```bash
npm install remark-abcjs
```
