My friend Jules made a fun suggestion on Bluesky recently:

<Bluesky uri="at://did:plc:ra3gxl2udc22odfbvcfslcn3/app.bsky.feed.post/3lk25eplens2o" cid="bafyreiebisw5cbd42fmftq7tmmljyxuczmlvyo6h6xpqb3wqsfij76xqlm" />

Let's step through the [search results](https://github.com/search?q=breq.dev&type=code) for my domain name on GitHub and see what we can find!

# eightyeightthirty.one

In 2023, some friends and I built a scraper tool called [eightyeightthirty.one](https://eightyeightthirty.one/) which attempted to map the entire graph of 88x31 buttons. Soon after, I wrote an article [applying network science to the 88x31 graph](/2023/12/26/88x31-science).

- [Tantek Ã‡elik](https://tantek.com/), the Web Standards Lead at Mozilla, liked my article enough to add it to the [IndieWiki page on 88x31s](https://indieweb.org/88x31)!
- [Julia Keadey](https://sylkos.xyz/) discussed the same article in a [blog post about her website design](https://sylkos.xyz/blog/0).

A few people credited my project page for the 88x31 scraper tool. Please credit [NotNite's portfolio](https://notnite.com/portfolio#eightyeightthirtyone) instead, she did most of the work!

# 5F3759DF

A few people have linked to my 2021 article on the [fast inverse square root algorithm](/2021/03/17/5F3759DF) in code over the years:

- `kvn13github`'s [Python implementation](https://github.com/kvn13github/0x5F3759DF-in-Python3-FastInverseSquareRoot/blob/main/FastInverseSquareRoot.py)
- `silvernuke911`'s [Python implementation](https://github.com/silvernuke911/Random-programs/blob/main/Fast_Inverse_Square_Root.py)

# Flowspace

At least one person other than myself has set up a profile on [Flowspace](/projects/flowspace), a social network demo I made in 2021.

- `R47n`'s [website](https://r74n.com/social/) links to their [Flowspace profile](https://flowspace.breq.dev/profile/525884243050905603).

# Accelcoin

In 2022 I was a teaching assistant for Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 at Northeastern. One of our course assignments was for students to build a working blockchain node implementation. I ran some infrastructure relating to this! Some students have published their code to GitHub.

# Wordle

In 2022 I published a few [implementations of the Wordle algorithm](https://breq.dev/projects/wordle) in TypeScript and Rust.

- [`turtywurty`](https://turtywurty.dev/)'s discord bot [SuperTurtyBot](https://github.com/DaRealTurtyWurty/SuperTurtyBot) includes Wordle functionality, [ported to Java](https://github.com/DaRealTurtyWurty/SuperTurtyBot/blob/d5e1499647a5eae15a596de73a57e522a175c4a8/src/main/java/dev/darealturtywurty/superturtybot/commands/minigames/WordleCommand.java#L686) from my implementation.
