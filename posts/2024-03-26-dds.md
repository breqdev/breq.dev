Picture this: you're developing a robot that you aim to control using a nice, clean user interface. Control goes through this UI on one laptop over a network connection to the robot, which runs its own SBC, all using standard ROS 2. You do a ton of testing, at first just with an Ethernet cable since you don't feel like dragging your radios out of the closet, and everything looks good! And then, you show up to an event with your robot, and you realize that whenever you switch views in the UI, suddenly your entire comms link grinds to a halt.

So, what gives?

# Discovery Traffic

This issue is a classic case of discovery traffic trashing your link. Whenever the UI subscribes to a new topic in ROS, the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware needs to figure out which node in the network is publishing that topic, so it generates a ton of multicast UDP traffic to send out to the network. This works fine over a high-bandwidth Ethernet link, but causes problems with a bandwidth-constrained radio connection.

When our team hit this, we took some Wireshark captures before and after. Here's the normal, working state of the network:

And here's after we generate a bit of DDS discovery traffic:

The unassembled fragments! The horror...
