I bought a Sony Mavica! And everything about this camera has been such a joy, I can't help but write about it :)

The _Digital Mavica_ line of cameras saved images directly onto a floppy disk. The model I own is the [MVC-FD90](https://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica_FD90) which was released in 2000. It captures images at a maximum resolution of 1280Ã—960, but I have often shot at 640Ã—480 to save space on the floppy disk (which can store around 20 photos).

# Inspiration

Earlier this year at [Anthro New England](https://www.anthronewengland.com/), my girlfriend [Mia](https://miakizz.quest/) was taking photos on her Mavica and let me try it a bit! It seemed like such a fun and whimsical camera to keep around. I was a bit intimidated by the floppy disks -- Mia has much more experience with retrocomputing than I do, and I worried that getting disks, a drive, pulling images off the camera, and keeping everything in good shape might be too difficult for me.

# Swapfest my beloved

It was at the most recent [MIT Swapfest](https://w1mx.mit.edu/flea-at-mit/) that I picked up my beloved Mavica. I purchased it from some very persuasive transfems who had a table dedicated exclusively to Mavica stuff. I bought the model they recommended and they helped me get set up with a battery, strap, etc.

I'm a big fan of Swapfest: it's almost more of a community gathering to me than a place to buy stuff. Whenever I go I see so many friends, former classmates, and colleagues I know from work. You get to know the tables that come back every month and the people who sell regularly. All in all, it's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!

# Meticulous unscheduled disassembly

Mavica experts will know that aftermarket batteries tend to be a bit oversized compared to the originals. The folks who sold me mine made sure I was aware of this and even gave me a ribbon to put around the battery. However, in my excitement to try it out, I totally forgot about this and immediately put the battery directly in. I had to disassemble the camera to get it out!

Big thanks to Sony for putting that plastic cover over the flash capacitor... that could've been a nasty shock otherwise ðŸ˜¬

# Playing around with my first disk

A few tables at Swapfest hand out free floppy disks to passerby. I had accumulated a total of three disks and found that, miraculously, one of them actually worked! While it started to break down and I might've lost one of my photos, it overall held up pretty well until I was able to get some actual disks.

At the time, I didn't have any way to read files off of the disk, so I just took as many as I could until it filled up.

# Getting a floppy reader and disks

Mia advised against me buying a random floppy drive on Amazon, so at the recommendation of my friend [Tris](https://tris.fyi/), I bought a Dell Latitude drive online for about $6. It's designed to be put into a slot on the laptop, but it actually just has a normal Mini-USB connector. I bought some disks from an Amazon listing that _looked_ legit (it was Maxell brand and had good reviews).
