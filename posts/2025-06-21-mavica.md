I bought a Sony Mavica! And everything about this camera has been such a joy, I can't help but write about it :)

The _Digital Mavica_ line of cameras saved images directly onto a floppy disk. The model I own is the [MVC-FD90](https://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica_FD90) which was released in 2000. It captures images at a maximum resolution of 1280×960, but I have often shot at 640×480 to save space on the floppy disk (which can store around 20 photos).

# Inspiration

Earlier this year at [Anthro New England](https://www.anthronewengland.com/), my girlfriend [Mia](https://miakizz.quest/) was taking photos on her Mavica and let me try it a bit! It seemed like such a fun and whimsical camera to keep around. I was a bit intimidated by the floppy disks -- Mia has much more experience with retrocomputing than I do, and I worried that getting disks, a drive, pulling images off the camera, and keeping everything in good shape might be too difficult for me.

# Swapfest my beloved

It was at the most recent [MIT Swapfest](https://w1mx.mit.edu/flea-at-mit/) that I picked up my beloved Mavica. I purchased it from some very persuasive transfems who had a table dedicated exclusively to Mavica stuff. I bought the model they recommended and they helped me get set up with a battery, strap, etc.

I'm a big fan of Swapfest: it's almost more of a community gathering to me than a place to buy stuff. Whenever I go I see so many friends, former classmates, and colleagues at work. The people who sell regularly are
