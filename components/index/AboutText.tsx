      <span className="font-bold text-panpink">hey, i'm brooke</span>, and i'm
      here to learn, create, and have fun.
      <br />
      <br />
      i'm passionate about embedded systems, backend engineering, web dev,
      audio, and bodging things together in creative ways.
      <br />
      <br />
      my favorite tools are Python, React, Rust, and Linux. most of my work
      nowadays is completely digital, but i'm still comfortable with a soldering
      iron and a breadboard.
      <br />
      <br />
      i believe that the only way to learn something fully is to be creative
      with it. you can never truly understand something without applying it to a
      problem yourself.
      <br />
      <br />
      i am openly, proudly, and unapologetically a queer transgender woman.
      <br />
      <br />
      technology should be for everyone. i think it's important to create tools
      and resources that help people express themselves creatively. i want to
      leave an impact on the world that i can be proud of.
      <br />
      <br />
      be excellent to each other.
