# hey, i'm brooke, and this is my website.

if you're just here to browse, you'll have a much better experience over on [breq.dev](https://breq.dev/).

but i've opened this up to let you peek into the internals if you'd like. look at my use of [nextjs plugins](next.config.js), skim through how i [manage tags](utils/tags.js), glance through how i made that [3D scrolling](src/components/index/Greeting.js) effect, or understand how i theme the [code snippets](src/components/markdown/Code.js). or, you could always spoil the [easter egg](src/components/index/TerminalWrapper.js) for yourself. nobody's gonna know you cheated but you.
