# Overview

Gemini was a simple canvas game I built. The player had to guide the black circle towards the white circle using the arrow keys, but the black circle is pushed around by a randomly changing current.

# Motivation

I wanted to make a simple game in order to learn JavaScript. I worked on this during a summer camp at MSSM, in an introductory programming course.

# Technical Description

Gemini was certainly a product of 2016. It was built with jQuery. The two balls are represented as JavaScript objects, but they're created using the prototype interface, as ES2015 classes weren't widely supported or documented at the time.

# Results

It was something I could show my friends, and it was something that helped me learn JavaScript, so I'd call it a success! That said, I'm glad my code quality has improved since I wrote this... :)
