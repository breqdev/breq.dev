Here's the autonomous routine I planned, developed, and tuned for the 2019 Maine State Championship on team 4393S. This autonomous routine got us the highest autonomous points ranking out of all 50 teams at the event.

This was my first experience with a robotics competition. I did most of the building and all of the programming for my team. Our team won two local tournaments, was a finalist at the state championship, won the design award at the state championship, and competed at the world championship. This experience improved my mechanical skills, understanding of the design process, embedded programming skills, and teamwork abilities.

Here are a few of the things I'm most proud of from my work on this team:
* Automatic aim using the VEX Vision Sensor to recognize flags
* Buttons to automatically shoot multiple flags in quick succession using state machine logic, including sensors to track the position of balls, automatic reloading logic, and angle presets
* Movement in an arc for saving time during the autonomous routine
