title: "What a singing fish toy taught me about practicality"
---

A couple months ago, my uncle and aunt asked me to modify a Billy Bass fish
to sing a Phoebe Bridgers song.

For those of you lucky enough to not know what the Billy Bass fish is, let me
enlighten you:

And for completeness, here was the song I needed to replace it with:

</div>

Oh yea, and there was another requirement--the entire project needed to be finished
in about a week. I had finals for the first half of the week, and I knew it would
take a while to ship to California, but I concluded that I could barely make it work
if I ordered the parts right away, rebuilt the fish as quickly as possible once
they arrived, and shipped the result as soon as possible.

With that in mind, I started to plan.

## The Core Problem

Somehow, I needed to replace the default Billy Bass song with this other song.
But where?

The chip that controls Billy Bass and plays the default music is covered in
epoxy. Much smarter people than me [struggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E0PWQvW-14)
to do this kind of thing. I quickly ruled this option out.

What about using the existing speakers though? Well, at the time, I didn't have
a physical Billy Bass handy (remember, shipping...) so I couldn't be sure of the
specifications of these speakers.

The easiest solution would be to completely replace the built-in electronics
with my own.

## Parts Shopping

Knowing that I had only a few days to get this working, and no opportunity
to re-order parts if something went wrong, I knew that I needed to get this
right.

I needed a cohesive ecosystem. [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/) has been my
go-to source for parts over the past couple years, and being based in NYC, I knew
shipping wouldn't take too long. But that still left me with plenty of options.

I started by identifying what physical hardware I'd need. Adafruit has a line
of [boards](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=VS1053&sort=BestMatch) based off of the
VS1053 chip--that takes care of my audio playing. And there are plenty of
motor boards available in any form factor I would want. So what do I choose?

Adafruit's board selection generally varies by size and power supply. The VS1053
modules were available in 3 different form factors: a simple breakout board,
a FeatherWing board, and an Arduino Shield board.

The breakout board would require wiring it up to a board myself, which eliminated
it from the running.
Feather boards and Arduino boards are available with any sort of chip, so that's
not a concern. What differentiates the boards is physical size and power supply.
Feathers are small, and can be powered off of a 5 volt source or a LiPo battery.
Arduinos are much larger, but they can take anything from 6 to 20 volts.

Here I faced a dillema. I wanted the electronics to be small, so that they could
fit inside the Billy Bass enclosure without any sort of external box. I also was
wary of running the chip and the motors off the same power rail, due to reset
issues I'd experienced in the past. The Arduino, with it's built-in power regulator,
seemed like functionally the better choice, as it could take a standard barrel
plug power supply, run the motors directly off of it, and run the microcontroller
chip off a clean, regulated 5V.

However, I wasn't sure if the larger Arduino form factor would fit. I considered
rigging something up with a custom perfboard to attach a voltage regulator to
the Feather... but I eventually decided against it. I needed to play by the rules
of the ecosystem, so I could take advantage of it's ease-of-use. I bought the
VS1053 and the motor driver for the Arduino.

Here's the finished product! You can see the Adafruit Metro (Arduino clone),
the speakers, and not much else. Because the VS1053 chip and motor driver were
mounted directly on top of the Metro, there was no need for messy mounting
solutions or manual wiring.

## Race to the MVP

And now, the race was on to get something functional as fast as possible. Getting
the song to play over the audio shield and speakers was easy, thanks to the
well-documented Adafruit libraries. That left only the fish motion to take care of.

Getting something working this quickly would have been impossible if I had tried
to roll my own amplifier circuit, or wire together my own power supply circuit,
or do any of that. Here was the ecosystem at work for me, allowing me to go from
idea to concept in record time.

## Moving the fish

The next step was to actually move the fish. I quickly wrote functions to control
the fish's head, tail, and mouth, again using the excellent library Adafruit
provided for their motor shield. Normally, I would've hacked something together
with an L293D in order to save a buck or two. But in this case, the motor shield was
worth every penny.

Now, the question is, how do I decide when to activate these movements?

The official Amazon Alexa enabled Billy Bass reacts to the audio to decide
when to move. This... doesn't exactly work well, as you can see in this Linus
Tech Tips review at around the 5:03 mark:

"Okay, so he just kind of spasms then. So basically, you just have like a fish
out of water on your wall whenever music is playing."

Yeah... that wasn't gonna cut it.

I decided I needed to manually choreograph the movements to match the music.
No reacting-to-audio trickery would save me from this. I did attempt
a few basic tests of reacting to audio loudness, but my results were even worse
than the fish in that video.

## Recording the movements

I realized that I would need to write some custom software if I wanted to
precisely record all of these movements in relation to the song. I needed a
framework that would let me play audio, handle raw keyboard events, and write
in a language I could iterate quickly in. PyGame fit the bill, and I was quickly
off to the races.

My script waited for the user to press the space key. It then started playing
the music and keeping an internal timer. Then, whenever another key was pressed,
it would log the event and the time at which it happened. Finally, it saved it
to a JSON file. Pretty basic stuff.

Did I have to decouple the recording from the code generation? Probably not.
But I figured it would be best to have a full record of all the movements over
the course of the song, so I could try different methods of storing that on the
fish if I needed to.

## Storing the movements

If I had the luxury of time, I might've gone with a packed binary representation
like I did for my [STMusic]({% link _hacks/stmusic.md %}) project. However, writing
the code to generate, store, and load this packed representation would be a lot
of work.

I eventually landed on the idea of using a Python script to take the JSON object
and *generate C code* that called each movement function.

{% highlight python %}
import json

with open("recorded.json") as file:
    actions = json.load(file)

code = []

action_lines = {
    "head": "  fish.head();",
    "tail": "  fish.tail();",
    "rest": "  fish.rest();",
    "mouthOpen": "  fish.setMouth(1);",
    "mouthClosed": "  fish.setMouth(0);"
}

total_ts = 0

for timestamp, action in actions.items():
    total_ts += float(timestamp)
    millis = int(float(total_ts)*1000)
    code.append(f"  delayUntil({millis});")
    code.append(action_lines[action])

generated = "\n".join(code)

with open("routine.ino", "w") as file:
    file.write("void routine() {\n")
    file.write(generated)
    file.write("\n}\n")
{% endhighlight %}

Give me a second, I have to wash the blood off my hands after murdering every
best practice in the book with this move.

To be clear--this method is *ugly*. It produces an excessively large binary,
it stores data in a file that people expect to be for application logic, it
adds an unintuitive step to the build process, it's just generally Not The Way
Things Are Supposed To Be Done.

But it worked. It kept the movements synched up to the song. At the end of the
day, the future maintainability or extensibility of this program isn't something
that mattered that much, and it was a worthwhile tradeoff in order to save some
valuable time.

## One Last Feature: the volume knob

After putting everything together, I noticed that the fish was perhaps too loud
to have in a room. At the last minute, I decided to try adding a volume knob.
But how to do it?

The "knob" part was easy enough: I just grabbed some spare parts from my dad's
work on repairing guitar amps. On the other hand, the "volume" part presented
more of a challenge. Should I go for an analog approach, and try to create
a circuit involving the knob that limited the output to the speaker? Or...

I had another idea. What if I used an analog input pin on the Arduino to read
the value of the knob, then sent that value to the VS1053 to adjust it's output
volume in software? This greatly simplified the wiring, so I went ahead and built
it.

Here, I made another tradeoff. I sampled this knob after each movement--not at a
regular interval, not at a reasonable sample rate, literally just after each
fish movement. And it was good enough! The variable amplitude of the song made
the jagged nature of this sampling less obvious.

This project taught me when good enough was good enough. I sometimes struggle
with perfectionism in my projects, where I'll rewrite the same code over and
over again in pursuit of a better way of doing things. This forced me to make
the tradeoffs I was too scared to make, and to decide what mattered for the
final product and what didn't.

And finally, here's the final product:
