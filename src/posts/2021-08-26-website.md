title: Building My Online Presence
---

I've always wanted to keep a personal website up and running. In part, that's because I want to make sure everything I work on has a home; hopefully, people can use my project writeups for inspiration or advice on their own creative endeavours. It's also partly because I want a place to share my thoughts. The main reason, however, is to keep a centralized directory of who I am.

For much of my life, my identity has been, for lack of a better word, unstable. This is an outlet for me to keep track of what makes me who I am. It's a place where I can post things that I'm proud of.

(Funnily enough, it was this period of questioning that led me to pick the name `breq.dev`. At the time, I knew I was deeply uncomfortable with my name, but I didn't yet understand why. When it came time to pick a domain name, I ended up scrolling through the [AVR instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR_instruction_set) until I found something somewhat pronounceable, and it's kinda stuck!)

With that out of the way, here's the journey my online presence took from both a technical and personal perspective.

# My First HTML

The first HTML file I ever hosted publicly was published on August 19, 2015. Here's that fateful commit:

As a 12-year-old with no money, it's no surprise I turned to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. And, as you can tell from the commit, I hadn't exactly figured out code indentation yet.

Over the years, this site turned into a disorganized collection of random `.html` files I happened to experiment with. That said, there were a few interesting projects I put up, like this simple canvas game I called "Gemini":

<div style="overflow: scroll;">
    <iframe width="1050" height="600" src="/statichtml/gemini.html" />
</div>

<Caption>Apologies to any mobile users out there -- this game really only works on desktop.</Caption>

I also made a homepage for my school laptop -- try pressing "space" and "c":

<div className="aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1">
    <iframe src="/statichtml/bounce.html" frameborder="0" />
</div>
