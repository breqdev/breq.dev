         * primarily from a StyledComponent, and we can't override those styles since they're
         * scoped. Thus, we set this style on .terminalContainer
         *
         * Make sure the ".terminalContainer" class name is present in a JS file,
         * so that it doesn't get purged! We need this rule to stick around.
