descriptions:
  - me in front of some rocks at an old dino dig!
  - our first airbnb was right near the mountains <3
  - equipment servicing challenge
  - (most of) our team, standing on a rock
  - testing in the gravel driveway at night looks like the moon
  - shannon's a weezer fan
  - hanksville dino dig. we don't have land like this on the east coast, lol
  - what does a 19-year-old transit nerd do to kill a few hours in vegas? ride the monorail, of course!
  - life detection challenge. our sciencey stuff wasn't working so we just took pictures of the rocks
  - the hab domes! the competition was at a mars simulation facility, we got to go inside
  - of course, the west coast tradition

we crimped cables. we took pictures of rocks. we stayed up way too late getting the software working. some of us even attempted (with limited success) to make smores at 2 in the morning with a lil blowtorch. we traversed the bumpiest road i've ever experienced, twice a day. we sprinted up every lil dirt mound we could find. and we might've let loose just a liiiitle bit too much once it was over. but above all, we roved!

im so glad i got to go on this trip with such amazing people, work on such an awesome project, get as close to mars as possible without leaving earth, and get to know my teammates as people so much more than i had before. and i can't wait to do it all (r)over again next year!
