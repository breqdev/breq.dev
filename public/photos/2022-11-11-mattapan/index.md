title: Mattapan Line
descriptions:
  - looking out the front of a PCC streetcar on the MBTA's Mattapan Line in Boston at night, at another oncoming streetcar
  - a view of the rear of the same streetcar, with darkness visible in the windows and rows of transverse seating inside the car
  - a picture of two streetcars in the train yard, one missing part of the car, with an SUV parked in front of them
  - another picture looking out the front of the streetcar, this time with the interior of the streetcar in focus
  - a picture of the illuminated sign that would previously scroll between saying "Mattapan" and "Ashmont"
  - a portrait of me at night
