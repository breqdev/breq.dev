"Brooke is a human dowsing rod, drawn to water at all times whether she likes it or not. part of her longs for the ocean's depths, another part is terrified of what she'll find. so far the second part has won, but it's getting weaker" -[Echo Nolan, 2020](https://twitter.com/enolan/status/1504662238774276097)
