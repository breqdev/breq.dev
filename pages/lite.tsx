            i'm passionate about embedded systems, backend engineering, web dev,
            and bodging things together in creative ways.
            <br />
            <br />
            my favorite tools are python, react, rust, and linux. most of my
            work nowadays is completely digital, but i'm still comfortable with
            a soldering iron and a breadboard.
            <br />

            i believe that the only way to learn something fully is to be
            creative with it. you can never truly understand something without
            applying it to a problem yourself.
            <br />
            <br />
            i'm a trans woman, and i'm still learning to love myself. i want to
            be myself and leave an impact on the world that i can be proud of.
            <br />
            <br />
            technology should be for everyone. i think it's important to create
            tools and resources that help people express themselves
            creativelyâ€”whether that's with code, or something else entirely. (we
            can't all spend our lives making websites with too much javascript.)
            <br />
            <br />
            be excellent to each other.
